# Fancy GapMinder

In this homework, you'll apply knowledge of animations and joins to create a scatterplot that animates as attribute and years for the dataset are updated, which is popularly known as the GapMinder scatterplot. **This assignment is worth 10 points.** It will include the following aspects:
* GapMinder scatterplot replicated using animations and joins in D3.js.
* Data downloaded from: [GapMinder Data website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* Displays a scatterplot that shows two selected attributes for a specific year for a regional set of countries (Africa, North America, etc.).
* Years can be updated by 
  1. inputting a specific year in an HTML `input` box, or 
  2. by starting/stopping an animation that iterates through the years.
* The current year is set in the background of the scatterplot and it updates as the year changes.
