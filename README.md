### GapMinder Scatterplot using D3.js ([Link](https://stuteeroutray.github.io/gapminder-scatterplot-d3-js/))

This assignment was done as part of CSE 578 - Data Visualization coursework at Arizona State University.

* GapMinder scatterplot replicated using animations and joins in D3.js.
* Data downloaded from: [GapMinder Data website](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* Displays a scatterplot that shows two selected attributes for a specific year for a regional set of countries (Africa, North America, etc.).
* Years can be updated by 
  - inputting a specific year in an HTML `input` box, or 
  - by starting/stopping an animation that iterates through the years.
* The current year is set in the background of the scatterplot and it updates as the year changes.
